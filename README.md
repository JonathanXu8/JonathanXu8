## 👋 Hi, I'm Jonathan!

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m currently a Computer Science student at the University of Maryland, College Park and I'm passionate about learning, experimenting, and shipping ideas. Whether it's backend systems, machine learning models, websites, or simple tools to make life easier, I love working on things that interest me and solve real problems.
